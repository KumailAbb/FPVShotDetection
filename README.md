# FPVShotDetection
Datasets released in the research paper titled "Front Pitch View Shot Extraction and Ball Tracking in Cricket using Deep-Learning".

# FPV Classification Dataset
Contains 5,000 Front Pitch View (FPV) frames and 5,000 Non-Front Pitch View (Non-FPV) frames. FPV is the frame in which the bowler is running to deliver the ball to the batter.

# Pitch & Umpire Detection Dataset
Contains 5,000 Front Pitch View (FPV) frames in which Umpire and Pitch are annotated for object detection training.

# Ball Tracking Dataset
Contains 3,000 red cricket balls from a test match annotated. Also include 6,979 negative samples with no balls present.

# Ball Delivery Classification
Contains 300 instances of ball deliveries in which each delivery is classified according to the ball's bounce position on the pitch. They are classified as full-pitched, good-length or short-pitched deliveries both as perceived by the author as well as by the model trained on Ball Tracking Dataset.
